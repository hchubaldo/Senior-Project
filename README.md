## How to run

With help from a Makefile we are able to build and run the script with a simple command.

1. Run the cmd: `make run`

Known Issue

1. Currently the script will generate a CSV that is incorrect. I am having a problem with tyring to figure it with Docker but the analysis is not affected by this. Output to screen should still be correct.
2. I included the images in the corrNetwork_images folder since I was having an issue with my script not running when trying to generate the images within the Docler container. The analysis should still run the output to screen should be correct.
