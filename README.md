## How to run

With help from a Makefile we are able to build and run the script with a simple command.

1. Run the cmd: `make run`

Known Issue
Currently the script will generate a CSV that is incorrect. I am having a problem with tyring to figure it with Docker but the analysis is not affected by this. Output to screen should still be correct.
